Code Book for UCI-HAR tidy data set:

UCI-HAR tidy data set is got by preprocessing the data obtained from the link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
This tidy data set has dimensions 180x81(180 rows and 81 columns).

This tidy data set gives the information about the average values of the each of the mean and standard deviation measurements.
These measurements are a collection of feature vectors calculated by using embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.
These experiments were carried out with 30 volunteers and these measurements were calculated by each individual performing six activites : (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
A full description of this experiment can be found here : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The measurements were pre-procesed and the following tidy data set was obtained. The variables in the tidy data set are the following:
Column 1 : activity : This column indicates the activity performed by the subject.It may contain any of these values:
           1 WALKING
	   2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	   3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	   4 SITTING
	   5 STANDING
	   6 LAYING

Column 2: subject : This column represents the subject id(the id of teh individual who performed the activity). It may be a value between 1 and 30.

Column 3-81 : These columns represent the average of each of the mean and standard deviation measurements for each activity performed by each individual.Since each feature is normalized between [-1,1], the average values are also between [-1,1].
 
         The mean and standard deviation measurements are got from a collection of 561 feature vectors. These feature vectors are got in the following methods:

	 The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
	 Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
	 Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

	 These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
